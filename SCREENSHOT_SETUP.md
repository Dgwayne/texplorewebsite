# Screenshot Setup Instructions

I've updated the configuration with alt text for your 5 screenshots. Here's what you need to do:

## Save Your Screenshots

Take the 5 screenshot images you uploaded and save them in the `/public/images/` folder with these exact names:

1. **screenshot-1.jpg** - Player with green weapon vs orange enemy
2. **screenshot-2.jpg** - MAX CRIT combat effects
3. **screenshot-3.jpg** - Top-down view with UI and minimap
4. **screenshot-4.jpg** - Jetpack descent with upgrade banner
5. **screenshot-5.jpg** - Deep mining at depth 494
6. **screenshot-6.jpg** - Side-scrolling mining action

## How to Save

1. Right-click each image you uploaded
2. "Save image as..." or "Save picture as..."
3. Navigate to: `C:\temp\texplore website\public\images\`
4. Save with the exact names above (screenshot-1.jpg, screenshot-2.jpg, etc.)

## Note

I've already configured the alt text in `siteConfig.ts` based on what I can see in your screenshots. The site will work once you place the files in the correct location.

## Still Need

- **6th screenshot** - You provided 5, but the site expects 6. You can:
  - Add one more screenshot, OR
  - Duplicate one of your existing screenshots as screenshot-6.jpg

**Once files are saved, your screenshots will display on the website!**
