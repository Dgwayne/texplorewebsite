# Screenshots Needed

I've updated all the URLs and content from your Steam page, but I need you to **download and add the screenshots** from your Steam page.

## What I Need

From your Steam store page, download **6 screenshots** and save them as:

1. `/public/images/screenshot-1.jpg`
2. `/public/images/screenshot-2.jpg`
3. `/public/images/screenshot-3.jpg`
4. `/public/images/screenshot-4.jpg`
5. `/public/images/screenshot-5.jpg`
6. `/public/images/screenshot-6.jpg`

## How to Get Screenshots from Steam

1. Go to your Steam store page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4197100/Texplore/
2. Scroll to the screenshots section
3. Right-click each screenshot → "Save image as..."
4. Save them with the names above in the `/public/images/` folder

## Alternative: I Can Help

If you upload the screenshot files here, I can:
- Rename them correctly
- Place them in the right folder
- Update the alt text in `siteConfig.ts` to match your game

## Also Needed

- **OG Image** (`/public/images/og-image.jpg`) - 1200x630px for social sharing
- **Favicon** (`/app/favicon.ico`) - Small icon for browser tabs

**Once you add the screenshots, your site will be ready to go!**
