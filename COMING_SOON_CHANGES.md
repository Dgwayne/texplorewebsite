I've updated your website to reflect "Coming Soon" status instead of "Available Now". Here's what changed:

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Purchase Section (`components/Purchase.tsx`)
- **Heading:** "Get the Full Game" → **"Coming Soon"**
- **Description:** "Available now on Steam" → **"Coming soon to Early Access! Wishlist on Steam to be notified when it launches."**
- **Button:** "Buy on Steam" → **"Wishlist on Steam"**
- **Direct Purchase:** "Buy Direct" → **"Pre-Order (Coming Soon)"**
- **Note:** Updated to mention direct purchase will be available at launch

### 2. Hero Section (`components/Hero.tsx`)
- **Button:** "Buy on Steam" → **"Wishlist on Steam"**

### 3. Header (`components/Header.tsx`)
